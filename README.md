**Please contribute! PRs welcome!**

## Mobile app
- Android; it's also [open-source](https://github.com/holt-soundboard/holt-soundboard-mobile)
- iOS (coming soon)

## How it started
~~There are quite a few Holt Soundboard apps on the Google PlayStore. None of them, however, were good enough for me. For example, none had sounds of Jake Peralta. So I decided to create my own.~~

~~October 2018, the Holt Soundboard Version 1 was ready! [Here's the post that started it all](https://www.reddit.com/r/brooklynninenine/comments/9om9cm/new_holt_soundboard_with_sounds_of_other/).~~

~~The app was first written in plain HTML/CSS/JS. The code slowly became unusable, to the point that I decided to rewrite the entire app in Angular. Yet again, the code became unusable. So here we have it in VueJS + NuxtJS!~~

~~Since then, I've also created a subreddit, [r/holt_soundboard](https://reddit.com/r/holt_soundboard). It's small, but it's a community!~~
